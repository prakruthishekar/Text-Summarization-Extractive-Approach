# Text-Summarization

This project aims to demonstrate text summarization using an extractive approach with the spaCy library for natural language processing.

### Overview
Text summarization is the process of generating a concise and coherent summary of a longer text while preserving the key information and main ideas. This project focuses on the extractive approach, which involves selecting and combining important sentences or phrases from the original text to create the summary.


### Customization and Improvements
The current implementation uses a basic extractive approach by ranking sentences based on their importance and selecting the top ones for the summary. You can further enhance the summarization process by considering the following:

Experiment with different spaCy models, such as larger models (en_core_web_md or en_core_web_lg), to potentially improve the quality of the summarization.
Explore additional text processing techniques, such as named entity recognition or coreference resolution, to handle specific challenges in the summarization task.
Implement advanced algorithms, such as graph-based ranking or clustering, to improve sentence selection and cohesion in the summary.
Incorporate user feedback and evaluation metrics to iterate and enhance the summarization model.
